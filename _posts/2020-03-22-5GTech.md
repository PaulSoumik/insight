# Introduction
5G is the fifth generation wireless technology for digital cellular networks that began wide deployment in 2019.The 5G networks are expected to supercharge Internet of Things technology, providing the infrastructure needed to carry huge amounts of data that allows for a smarter and more connected world. 5G is enabling a new wave of innovation. It has the potential for changing the world, further powering the hottest trends in tech today : IoT (Internet of Things), AI (Artificial Intelligence) and AR (Augmented Reality) – among many more.

Amid so much hype about IoT(Internet of Things),news about Smart Homes, Smart Cities, at few places labs have been set up about IoT. You can understand IoT by imagining a fridge which can give alerts about some daily items like butter/ bread needing replenishment and hence placing order automatically from the grocery store without the human intervention . Similarly , the home AC & water heater getting switched on when the owner is leaving for home from the office. All this could be possible through the 5G deployment.

The next in the row -5G Technology is going to be launched in 2020 in **Tokyo Olympics**. Japan has decided to carry out live broadcasting of the Olympics Games through 5G. Hence there are extensive trials & testing. The testing is taking place in many countries like USA, France, Japan, China, Germany etc. There is a test bed in IIT Delhi established by Ericsson. Before digging in further, it is important to know the deficiencies of 4G first which is currently in use. After all, it is pertinent to know the need of 5G and also the high data speeds.

# Why isn't 4G enough ?
It’s comparatively low data speed- we are able to achieve peak data speed up to about 24 Mbps on our mobile handsets over the air interface. Moreover, the signal strength & data speed reduces further inside the buildings in the areas like in bathrooms, basement etc. Hence, there is the need of improvement in Indoor coverage, reliability of network. Well 5G is here to the rescue!

## Objectives of 5G
- 1-10Gbps data rates to subscribers or UE (user equipment), endpoints.
- One (01) millisecond end-to-end round-trip delay (latency).
- 1000x bandwidth per unit area as compared to the present.
- 10-100x number of connected devices as compared current usage.
- 99.999% availability (perception to the user).
- 100% coverage (perception to the user).
- 90% reduction in network energy consumption/usage as compared to 4G
- Expected up to ten-year battery life for low power, machine-type devices, which seems to be more suitable to address the growing relevant needs of the future generation.

**The 5G spectrum has been identified around 6GHz, 24 GHz, 40 GHz. The development is under process to meet all the above objectives.**

# What makes 5G technology unique ?

The research is under full swing to come out with more detailed features on Internet of things (IoT). There will be more smart homes, smart cities, smart offices in function in near future. Moreover, testing process is also underway to develop Autonomous vehicles/driver less cars. First, the 5G enabled handsets will be made available by the mid of year 2019. Another segment to be catered is improvement in batteries. Presently we are using Lithium Ion batteries which have a life span of about 1100 to 1200 cycles of charging & discharging which is equivalent to three years of a battery life. Also, the Lithium ion battery is costly, heavy and slow charging rate. Hence considerable improvement is required in battery technology too.

# Disadvantages
Meanwhile with the increased and continued use of 5G devices around human will cause health harms too. Due to emission of nonstop radiation, electromagnetic noise pollution will increase. This may further exaggerate the associated health hazards. Therefore, all human being should take adequate precautions while using the instruments for a long duration. It is also important to keep the radiating device away from the children. Till the time the new findings arrive, we must ensure that the technology create just a win-win situation to improve convenience and bring efficiency to our work process.

_Combining revolutionary levels of efficiency with higher capacities to send data : that’s 5G.Not only will it tangibly benefit you, it’s here to benefit societies across the globe, and it’s equipping industries to many things. Better yet, this new era of advancement is just getting started._
